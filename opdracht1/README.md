## The list.
* Images
* Custom Fonts
* Javascript
* Color
* broadband
* Cookies

## Images
The images are coming from an Api, unfortunately its not really useful to compress an incoming code from the third party.

## Custom Fonts
I'm not using any custom fonts. I've got the privilege from the google web fonts. :clap:

## Javascript


## Color
